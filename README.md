# OMART 
This project is designed to give the user an ease access to purchase some products like computer accessories, shoes and mobiles. The system would begin with acquiring the name of our user and welcoming them into the system. Further, they will be provided with a category of item that the system offers for purchase, namely, Computer Accessories, Shoes and Mobile phones. The user would be asked to input the choice of their want. Once the input is received, the system would display the choices available in that category to the user along with the cost value of the product. Then, the user is free to select their preference and enter it in the system to add it to their cart. The system displays them their total costs and gives them an offer to revise their cart it they want to anything more or exit the system with their purchase. If they select add more items to the cart, they are led back to the start and offered the categories again. But if the user selects exit, he is led out of the system. The user is displayed his final amount to pay and a thank you for visiting by the system.
